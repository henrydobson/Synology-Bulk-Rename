# Synology_Bulk_Rename

Two scripts to handle bulk file renaming on Synology FS.

Tested on DSM 5.

Currently the scripts are configured to substitute illegal SMB
characters for underscores.

PLEASE BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL USING THESE SCRIPT. I PROVIDE THEM WITHOUT
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND.
